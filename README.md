# Interactive Knob Buttons Collection | Free UI Components

A comprehensive collection of **free, open-source, customizable knob controls with integrated push buttons** - perfect for web-based audio applications, control panels, IoT interfaces, and more. These components are designed to provide intuitive, tactile user experiences for your web projects.

## üéõÔ∏è Why This Collection Exists

As a developer passionate about creating intuitive user interfaces, I found myself repeatedly implementing rotary knob controls with integrated buttons for various projects. Each implementation taught me something new about creating engaging, tactile experiences on the web.

I created this collection to:

- Explore different UI/UX approaches to the same interaction pattern
- Experiment with various visual styles and feedback mechanisms
- Provide the community with ready-to-use, customizable components
- Share knowledge about creating complex interactive controls

Rather than keeping these implementations to myself, I'm sharing them with the community under an open license so others can benefit from my explorations.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multiple Implementation Styles**: From minimalist to skeuomorphic designs
- **Fully Customizable**: Easily adjust colors, sizes, and behaviors
- **Responsive**: Works across desktop and mobile devices
- **Accessible**: Keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes included in modern implementations
- **Zero Dependencies**: Core implementations use vanilla JavaScript (some demos use optional libraries like GSAP for enhanced animations)
- **Event-Driven API**: Simple event system for integration with your applications

## üöÄ Usage

Each knob implementation is contained in its own HTML file with inline CSS and JavaScript. To use in your project:

1. Copy the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from the implementation you prefer
2. Integrate into your project structure
3. Customize colors, sizes, and behavior using CSS variables and configuration options
4. Connect to your application logic using the provided event listeners

### Basic Implementation Example

```html
<!-- HTML Structure -->
<div class="knob-container" id="myKnob">
    <div class="knob">
        <div class="indicator"></div>
        <div class="center-button"></div>
    </div>
</div>

<!-- JavaScript -->
<script>
    const knob = document.getElementById('myKnob');

    // Listen for value changes
    knob.addEventListener('knobchange', (event) => {
        console.log('Knob value changed:', event.detail.value);
        // Update your application state
    });

    // Listen for button clicks
    knob.addEventListener('buttonclick', () => {
        console.log('Center button clicked!');
        // Trigger your application action
    });
</script>
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

Each implementation uses CSS variables for easy customization:

```css
:root {
    --knob-size: 200px;
    --knob-bg-color: #333;
    --indicator-color: #00aaff;
    /* Additional variables specific to each implementation */
}
```

Modify these variables to match your application's design system.

## üì± Responsive Behavior

All knobs are designed to work across devices. For mobile optimization:

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    :root {
        --knob-size: 150px; /* Smaller on mobile */
    }
}
```
